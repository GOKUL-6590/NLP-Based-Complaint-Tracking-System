## Scope

The **Computer Systems Complaint Tracking** system aims to streamline and automate the entire repair request and tracking process for the **Test and Repair Centre (TRC)** department. This system will reduce manual interventions, improve communication between requesters, technicians, and admins, and increase operational efficiency. The primary scope of the project includes:

- Automating the submission, categorization, and tracking of repair requests.
- Assigning repair tickets to technicians, tracking parts used, and logging labor hours.
- Managing spare parts and inventory for repair activities.
- Generating reports on technician performance, request status, and system health.
- Providing notifications for each key action in the repair process, such as ticket assignment, task completion, and feedback submission.
- Enabling communication between requesters, technicians, and admins through the portal.

The project aims to eliminate the reliance on paper-based tracking, ensuring a digital workflow that enhances visibility and reduces delays in the repair process.

## Objective

The objective of the **Computer Systems Complaint Tracking** project is to create a comprehensive solution for the TRC department that automates the entire repair management lifecycle, from request submission to task completion. The key objectives are:

1. **Efficient Ticket Management**: Provide a platform for requesters to submit repair tickets, track their status, and receive updates on the progress of repairs.
2. **Technician Assignment and Tracking**: Ensure that repair tickets are assigned to the appropriate technician, with detailed logs on the repair process, parts used, and time spent.
3. **Parts and Inventory Management**: Enable technicians to request spare parts, track inventory usage, and ensure that parts are available when needed for repairs.
4. **Improved Communication**: Facilitate better communication between faculty/staff (requesters), technicians, and admins, reducing delays and misunderstandings.
5. **Feedback and Reporting**: Collect feedback from requesters on completed repairs, and allow admins to generate reports for performance monitoring, decision-making, and future improvements.
6. **Automated Notifications**: Ensure that all stakeholders are notified in real time about updates, changes, and task completions related to repair tickets.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to significantly improve the workflow of the TRC department, increase operational transparency, and enhance the overall efficiency of the repair and maintenance process.
